-1- catching signals
+ Compile code
gcc stack_traces.c

+ run code
./a.out

+ Uncomment a different problem in cause_calamity() recompile and run again.
+ Inspect the code and see how the signals are catched and handled. 


-2- Attaching debugger and look at stack

rm -rf a.out*
gcc stack_traces.c

+ On Linux 
objdump -h a.out 
gdb ./a.out
(gdb) run
(gdb) where
(gdb) quit

+On Apple OSX :
gcc stack_traces.c
objdump -h a.out 
(can also try other options "-hl" of objdump)
lldb a.out
(lldb) run
(lldb) bt
(lldb) quit


+ recompile code enabling debug information inserted in the code
rm -rf a.out*
gcc -g stack_traces.c

and attach debugger and run the same commands in the debugger

To inspect the headers in the object file
+ On Linux 
objdump -h a.out 

+ On Apple OSX :
objdump -h  a.out.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/a.out



-3- Flame Graph

perf record -g ./a.out 
perf report -n --stdio
